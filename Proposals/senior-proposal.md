# Seniors Spring Intensive Deliverable Proposal 

Dates 3/16-3/25

**Zurich Okoren**


**Project Name: Tree of Life** 


It is and **OLD** project that I will work **SOLO** on.


## Description

For this project I will be improving upon my "Tree of Life" project, where I optimized the runtime complexity of rendering and re-rendering Conway's Game of life.

## Objective 1: Update only the effected quadrants based on board state

Currently, the underlying tree data structure that holds the information about the board state is destroyed and rebuilt in its entirety. However, it is possible to refactor it so that instead of creating and destroying the entire tree, it only modifies the quadrants that hold the relevant information of the cells that need to be re-rendered.

In order to demonstrate completion, the tree-of life must behave exactly as it does when users are seeing it in action on the web, but the data structure has a few additional methods that keep track of and modify relevant quadrants.

## Objective 2: Add Buttons to enhance User Experience

Currently, there are no elements in place that let the user interact with the visualizer. In order to make it more attractive, I want to add some form of interaction with users in order to make it more engaging for the users.

To complete this task, I will add a pause, play, refresh and frame by frame buttons.

## Objective 3: Improve UI

The project is devoid of any elements of conventional and attractive UI, so I hope to improve the basic CSS that is in place to make a more visually appealing interface.

Completion is indicated by the presence of Design Elements such as a visual hierarchy and a pleasing color palette.

## Stretch goals (optional):

**What stretch goals do you have for your project?**
